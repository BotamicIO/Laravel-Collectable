# Laravel Collectable

I would appreciate you taking the time to look at my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/faustbrian) and considering to support me if I'm saving you some time with my work.

## Installation

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

``` bash
$ composer require faustbrian/laravel-collectable
```

And then include the service provider within `app/config/app.php`.

``` php
BrianFaust\Collectable\CollectableServiceProvider::class
```

To get started, you'll need to publish the vendor assets and migrate:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BrianFaust\Collectable\CollectableServiceProvider" && php artisan migrate
```

## Usage

<?php

namespace App;

use BrianFaust\Collectable\HasCollectionsTrait;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model implements HasCollections
{
    use HasCollectionsTrait;
}
```

##### Add an item to the collection.
``` php
$user->collection('favorites')->push($model);
